# Operating Systems Laboratory

This series of projects was developed as part of the 8th semester course, Operating Systems Laboratory (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by Georgios Goumas in the fall semester of 2018. At this project we implemented our own task scheduler (master/ex1) using linux cgroups , our own linux device driver for a wireless sensor (master/ex2) and our own Cryptographic device driver using virtualization (master/ex3).
